= be_valid_asset

Provides be_valid_xhtml and (soon) be_valid_css matchers for rspec controller and view tests.

== Installation

To use rspec_hpricot_matchers in your project, install the plugin:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/unboxed/be_valid_asset.git

Add the following to your spec_helper.rb file:
  
  require 'be_valid_asset'

== Usage

It can be used to test either an ActionController Response object as follows:

    describe FooController do
      integrate_views

      describe "GET 'index'" do
        it "should have valid markup" do
          get 'index'
          response.should be_valid_xhtml
        end
      end
    end

or a string:

    it "should be valid xhtml" do
      html = File.read(File.join(RAILS_ROOT, %w(public index.html)))
      html.should be_valid_xhtml
    end

== Configuration

TODO: Configuration details

== Notes

This currently does not support validating html fragments (whole documents only). Will be in a future release.

CSS validation will be in a future release.
